The beginning of the function is the same as the non-bonus function when
the changes were made in the step of pasting the strips.

In the first stage, I created three images:

1. mask - Built as in the non-bonus function when instead of strips
   from the picture I put strips of the same size in alternating colors
   black and white

2. Even strips - I pasted the Even strips in the same place they should
   be according to the non-bonus function.
   The difference is that I extended each strip on the right and left.
   The meeting line of any two adjacent Even strips is the center of
   the Odd strip that was supposed to be between them.

3. Odd strips - I pasted the odd strips in the same place they should
   be according to the non-bonus function.
   The difference is that I extended each strip on the right and left.
   The meeting line of any two adjacent odd strips is the center of the
   even strip that was supposed to be between them.

Finally after creating the images I performed pyramid blending for each
 image channel and put the result in the panorama image.

To adapt the process to images that are not powers of 2, I put each of
 the 3 images in the smallest rectangle that contains the panorama and
 that has sides that are powers of 2.

After the pyramid blending I cut the rectangle back to the size of the
 pyramid.
